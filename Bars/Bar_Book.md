#  Bar-Book

### 1. Beastie Boys – *“Hold It Now, Hit It”* (1986)  
> “What’s the word?  
> It’s time to buy ale!  
> If we run out of ale,  
> We drink the Thunderbird wine!”

- **Context:** Beasties clowning, but also slipping in Ernest Gallo’s notorious *Thunderbird* ad slogan — a skid-row call-and-response hustle.  
- **Personal resonance:** Midnight panic + memory of your grandfather AJ → recognition that what sounds like dumb party bars is actually coded cultural history.  
- **Usage:** Reminder that beneath chaos, there’s always a subtext. Look deeper.

### 2. The Streets – *“Turn the Page”* (2002)  
> “Turn the page, clock the rage,  
> Rip it out and stick it in your scrapbook.”

- **Context:** Mike Skinner opening *Original Pirate Material* with his “everyday life as bars” manifesto.  
- **Personal resonance:** When panic surges at 1:30AM, instead of burning the moment down, save it — write it, log it, make it art.  
- **Usage:** Panic → poetry. Rage → record.

### 3. Public Enemy – *“Fight the Power”* (1989)  
> “Elvis was a hero to most,  
> But he never meant s*** to me.”

- **Context:** Chuck D dismantling cultural idols, centering Black voices against the myth of white rock icons.  
- **Personal resonance:** A reminder that cultural “truths” can be challenged head-on — you don’t have to swallow what’s fed.  
- **Usage:** When authority or legacy feels heavy, cut through it with your own truth.

### 4. The Clash – *“Guns of Brixton”* (1979)  
> “When the law breaks in,  
> How you gonna go?  
> Shot down on the pavement,  
> Or waiting on death row?”

- **Context:** Written and sung by Paul Simonon, reggae-driven anthem of tension, cops, and survival under pressure. One of the first punk/reggae fusions that carried the *feel* of hip-hop menace before hip-hop itself crossed over.  
- **Personal resonance:** Not Strummer’s cleverness, but Simonon’s bluntness — heavy, dubby, fatalistic. Mirrors your own survival questions: *when the squeeze comes, how do you go out?*  
- **Usage:** When panic or authority presses down, it’s the soundtrack to fight-or-flight. A reminder that survival is always a choice, even when the options are brutal.

### 5. Jay-Z – *“Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)”* (2005)  
> “I’m not a businessman,  
> I’m a business, man.”

- **Context:** Hov’s flex redefining himself not just as an artist but as an empire.  
- **Personal resonance:** A reminder that you’re more than your role — your whole life, skills, and presence *is* the enterprise.  
- **Usage:** When self-worth wavers, remember you *are* the brand, the structure, the legacy.
